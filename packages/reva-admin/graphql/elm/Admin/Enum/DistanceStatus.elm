{-| Convert from a String representation to an elm representation enum.
This is the inverse of the Enum `toString` function. So you can call `toString` and then convert back `fromString` safely.

        |> Swapi.Enum.Episode.fromString

This can be useful for generating Strings to use for <select> menus to check which item was selected.
